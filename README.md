# 🌟YATZY 🎲


I created a console-based **Yatzy** dice.

## 🎯 Target of game

The objective of the game is for players to roll five dice and score points by forming specific combinations. Following the classic Yatzy rules, players must carefully choose which dice to keep and which to reroll in order to maximize their score over the course of multiple rounds. The key to success lies in strategic decision-making and optimizing each roll to achieve the highest-scoring combinations

## 📖 Rules & how to play 

<h3>Rules</h3>

<b>1.</b> Game Setup: Each player takes turns rolling five dice up to three times per turn.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b> Turn: On each turn, a player can roll the dice, choose which to keep, and re-roll the others. After three rolls (or sooner if desired), they must select a combination to score.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b> Scorecard: Players fill out a scorecard with different categories, like "Three of a Kind," "Four of a Kind," "Full House," "Small Straight," "Large Straight," "Yatzy" (all five dice the same), and "Chance" (any combination).<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b> Winning: After all rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.<br>
<br>
Key Combinations:
- Yatzy (5 of a kind): 50 points
- Full House (3 of a kind + pair): 25 points
- Small Straight (sequence of 4 dice): 30 points
- Large Straight (sequence of 5 dice): 40 points
Players aim to fill their scorecard strategically to maximize points.
